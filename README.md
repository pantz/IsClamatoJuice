## Is Clamato Juice?

In the case of Eric Dufour (DOUF) vs The Garys (GARYS) it was found that Clamato is, in fact, Juice. Despite clearly being labelled as only 37% juice.

Wikipedia defines [Clamato](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/clamato) as:

>a beverage that is made from Clam Juice and Tomato Juice used to make Bloody Caesar cocktails 

Gin and Juice is noteably absent from the list of beverages that Clamato is used for.

[Dr Pepper Snapple Brands (DPS on the NYSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dr_Pepper_Snapple_brands) specifically state on their own page that Clamato is actually classified as a "Beverage Mixer" and not a "Juice, Tea or other" beverage.
